Overview and Summary :

A US celebrity chef James Oliver has his own chain of restaurants,

The Grill House, across different cities in the USA. He wanted to put a new Restaurant Management System to track the day-to-day management of his restaurant.

Currently they have a paper-based system for the same and this has many issues. Currently the orders were taken by the waiters on paper and a paper-based bill was presented to the customers.

All the bills were entered into an excel sheet by the manager at EOD to know the total sales and item wise sales for the day. Then reports were generated on excel to know trends and details like daily, weekly, and monthly sales. Which dishes were popular and which weren’t doing so well?

Restaurants need a system that will allow them to easily update their menu. The clients currently do not have a system that recognizes the different types of users such as managers, waiters, etc. And they would like to be able to limit the access of some options of the system to certain users.

The client invited Business Analysts trained at SimpliLearn to capture the requirements for the creation of this software.
